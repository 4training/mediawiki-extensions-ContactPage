Some custom changes on the ContactPage extension for 4training.net:

- added fields for phone number and place
- always use same sender email (avoiding loss of email because of suspected email spoofing)
- custom email body
- avoiding PHP warnings

TODO: fix some of this directly in the mediawiki ContactPage repository?
